Master Thesis- JADS DS&amp;E

This repository has all the files that were used to build the ensemble model in my Master Thesis. 
The Jupyter Notebooks have all the (anonymized) code in them, the datasets could not be disclosed. 
The necessary modules have also been uploaded to this repository. 
Following (most parts) of the notebooks allows you to rebuild the ensemble model using own data.
However, several parts of the code are very dataset-specific.
